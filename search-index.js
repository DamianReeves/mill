we have shown how to work with the Mill default Scala module layout. Here we will explore some other common project layouts that you may want in your Scala build: build.sc object core extends JavaModule { object test extends Tests with TestModule.Junit4 } object app extends JavaModule { def moduleDeps = Seq(core) object test extends Tests with TestModule.Junit4 } This build is a two-module Java project with junit test suites. It expects the following filesystem layout: build.sc app/ src/hello/ Main.java test/src/hello/ MyAppTests.java core/ src/hello/ Core.java test/src/hello/ MyCoreTests.java You can then run the junit tests using mill app.test or mill core.test, and configure which exact tests you want to run using the flags defined on the JUnit Test Interface. For a more more complex, real-world example of a Java build, check out our example build for the popular Caffeine project: Example Build build.sc import mill._ import mill.scalalib._ object foo extends Cross[FooModule](\"2.10.6\", \"2.11.11\", \"2.12.4\") class FooModule(val crossScalaVersion: String) extends CrossScalaModule { ... object test extends Tests { ... } } Mill provides a CrossScalaModule template, which can be used with Cross to cross-build Scala modules across different versions of Scala. The default configuration for CrossScalaModule expects a filesystem layout as follows: build.sc foo/ src/ src-2.10/ src-2.11/ src-2.12/ test/ src/ src-2.10/ src-2.11/ src-2.12/ Code common to all Scala versions lives in src, while code specific to one version lives in src-x.y. build.sc import mill._ import mill.scalajslib._ object foo extends ScalaJSModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def scalaJSVersion = \"0.6.22\" } ScalaJSModule is a variant of ScalaModule that builds your code using Scala.js. In addition to the standard foo.compile and foo.run commands (the latter of which runs your code on Node.js, which must be pre-installed) ScalaJSModule also exposes the foo.fastOpt and foo.fullOpt tasks for generating the optimized Javascript file. build.sc import mill._, scalalib._, scalanativelib._ object hello extends ScalaNativeModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.11.12\" def scalaNativeVersion = \"0.3.8\" def logLevel = NativeLogLevel.Info // optional def releaseMode = ReleaseMode.Debug // optional } . ├── build.sc └── hello ├── src │ └── hello │ └── Hello.scala hello/src/hello/Hello.scala package hello import scalatags.Text.all._ object Hello{ def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = { println(\"Hello! \" + args.toList) println(div(\"one\")) } } The normal commands mill hello.compile, mill hello.run, all work. If you want to build a standalone executable, you can use mill show hello.nativeLink to create it. ScalaNativeModule builds scala sources to executable binaries using Scala Native. You will need to have the relevant parts of the LLVM toolchain installed on your system. Optimized binaries can be built by setting releaseMode (see above) and more verbose logging can be enabled using logLevel. Currently two test frameworks are supported utest and scalatest. Support for scalacheck should be possible when the relevant artifacts have been published for scala native. Here’s a slightly larger example, demonstrating how to use third party dependencies (note the two sets of double-colons :: necessary) and a test suite: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._, scalanativelib._ object hello extends ScalaNativeModule { def scalaNativeVersion = \"0.3.8\" def scalaVersion = \"2.11.12\" def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy\"com.lihaoyi::scalatags::0.6.7\") object test extends Tests with TestModule.Utest { def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy\"com.lihaoyi::utest::0.6.3\") } } . ├── build.sc └── hello ├── src │ └── hello │ └── Hello.scala └── test └── src └── HelloTests.scala hello/test/src/HelloTests.scala package hello import utest._ import scalatags.Text.all._ object HelloTests extends TestSuite{ val tests = Tests{ 'pass - { assert(div(\"1\").toString == \"1\") } 'fail - { assert(123 == 1243) } } } The same mill hello.compile or mill hello.run still work, as does `mill hello.test to run the test suite defined here. build.sc import mill._ import mill.scalalib._ object foo extends SbtModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" } These are basically the same as normal ScalaModules, but configured to follow the SBT project layout: build.sc foo/ src/ main/ scala/ test/ scala/ Useful if you want to migrate an existing project built with SBT without having to re-organize all your files build.sc import mill._ import mill.scalalib._ object foo extends Cross[FooModule](\"2.10.6\", \"2.11.11\", \"2.12.4\") class FooModule(val crossScalaVersion: String) extends CrossSbtModule { ... object test extends Tests { ... } } A CrossSbtModule is a version of CrossScalaModule configured with the SBT project layout: build.sc foo/ src/ main/ scala/ scala-2.10/ scala-2.11/ scala-2.12/ test/ scala/ scala-2.10/ scala-2.11/ scala-2.12/ build.sc import mill._ import mill.scalalib._ import mill.scalalib.publish._ object foo extends ScalaModule with PublishModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def publishVersion = \"0.0.1\" def pomSettings = PomSettings( description = \"My first library\", organization = \"com.lihaoyi\", url = \"https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill\", licenses = Seq(License.MIT), versionControl = VersionControl.github(\"lihaoyi\", \"mill\"), developers = Seq( Developer(\"lihaoyi\", \"Li Haoyi\", \"https://github.com/lihaoyi\") ) ) } You can make a module publishable by extending PublishModule. PublishModule then needs you to define a publishVersion and pomSettings. The artifactName defaults to the name of your module (in this case foo) but can be overridden. The organization is defined in pomSettings. Once you’ve mixed in PublishModule, you can publish your libraries to maven central via: mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll \\ foo.publishArtifacts \\ lihaoyi:$SONATYPE_PASSWORD \\ --gpgArgs --passphrase=$GPG_PASSWORD,--batch,--yes,-a,-b This uploads them to oss.sonatype.org where you can log-in and stage/release them manually. You can also pass in the --release true flag to perform the staging/release automatically: mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll \\ foo.publishArtifacts \\ lihaoyi:$SONATYPE_PASSWORD \\ --gpgArgs --passphrase=$GPG_PASSWORD,--batch,--yes,-a,-b \\ --release true If you want to publish/release multiple modules, you can use the or _ wildcard syntax: mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll \\ __.publishArtifacts \\ lihaoyi:$SONATYPE_PASSWORD \\ --gpgArgs --passphrase=$GPG_PASSWORD,--batch,--yes,-a,-b \\ --release true To publish to repository other than oss.sonaytype.org such as internal hosted nexus at example.company.com, you can pass in the --sonatypeUri and --sonatypeSnapshotUri parameters to uploads to different site: mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll \\ foo.publishArtifacts \\ lihaoyi:$SONATYPE_PASSWORD \\ --sonatypeUri http://example.company.com/release \\ --sonatypeSnaphostUri http://example.company.com/snapshot If the site does not support staging release as oss.sonatype.org does (for example, a self-hosted OSS nexus site), you can pass in the --stagingRelease false to simply upload release artifacts to corresponding maven path under sonatypeUri instead of staging path. mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll \\ foo.publishArtifacts \\ lihaoyi:$SONATYPE_PASSWORD \\ --sonatypeUri http://example.company.com/release \\ --stagingRelease false Mill comes bundled with example builds for existing open-source projects, as integration tests and examples: Mill Build A small single-module cross-build, with few sources, minimal dependencies, and wired up for publishing to Maven Central. Mill Build A collection of small modules compiled for a single Scala version. Also demonstrates how to define shared configuration in a trait, enable Scala compiler flags, and download artifacts as part of the build. Mill Build A collection of relatively small modules, all cross-built across the same few versions of Scala. Mill Build A single cross-platform Scala.js/Scala-JVM module cross-built against multiple versions of Scala, including the setup necessary for publishing to Maven Central. Mill Build A relatively complex build with numerous submodules, some cross-built across Scala major versions while others are cross-built against Scala minor versions. Also demonstrates how to pass one module’s compiled artifacts to the run/test commands of another, via their forkEnv.","title":"Common Project Layouts","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Common_Project_Layouts","url":"/mill/Common_Project_Layouts.html","titles":[{"text":"Java Project with Test Suite","hash":"_java_project_with_test_suite","id":1},{"text":"Cross Scala-Version Modules","hash":"_cross_scala_version_modules","id":2},{"text":"Scala.js Modules","hash":"_scala_js_modules","id":3},{"text":"Scala Native Modules","hash":"_scala_native_modules","id":4},{"text":"SBT-Compatible Modules","hash":"_sbt_compatible_modules","id":5},{"text":"SBT-Compatible Cross Scala-Version Modules","hash":"_sbt_compatible_cross_scala_version_modules","id":6},{"text":"Publishing","hash":"_publishing","id":7},{"text":"Example Builds","hash":"_example_builds","id":8},{"text":"Acyclic","hash":"_acyclic","id":9},{"text":"Better-Files","hash":"_better_files","id":10},{"text":"Jawn","hash":"_jawn","id":11},{"text":"Upickle","hash":"_upickle","id":12},{"text":"Ammonite","hash":"_ammonite","id":13}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"You can configure your Mill build in a number of ways: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def scalacOptions = Seq(\"-Ydelambdafy:inline\") def forkArgs = Seq(\"-Xmx4g\") def forkEnv = Map(\"HELLO_MY_ENV_VAR\" -> \"WORLD\") } You can pass flags to the Scala compiler via scalacOptions. By default, foo.run runs the compiled code in a subprocess, and you can pass in JVM flags via forkArgs or environment-variables via forkEnv. You can also run your code via mill foo.runLocal Which runs it in-process within an isolated classloader. This may be faster since you avoid the JVM startup, but does not support forkArgs or forkEnv. If you want to pass main-method arguments to run or runLocal, simply pass them after the foo.run/foo.runLocal: mill foo.run arg1 arg2 arg3 mill foo.runLocal arg1 arg2 arg3 build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def ivyDeps = Agg( ivy\"com.lihaoyi::upickle:0.5.1\", ivy\"com.lihaoyi::pprint:0.5.2\", ivy\"com.lihaoyi::fansi:0.2.4\", ivy\"${scalaOrganization()}:scala-reflect:${scalaVersion()}\" ) } You can define the ivyDeps field to add ivy dependencies to your module. The ivy\"com.lihaoyi::upickle:0.5.1\" syntax (with ::) represents Scala dependencies; for Java dependencies you would use a single : e.g. \"ivy\"com.lihaoyi:upickle:0.5.1\". If you have dependencies cross-published against the full Scala version (eg. 2.12.4 instead of just 2.12), you can use ::: as in ivy\"org.scalamacros:::paradise:2.1.1\". To select the test-jars from a dependency use the following syntax: ivy\"org.apache.spark::spark-sql:2.4.0;classifier=tests. By default, these are resolved from maven central, but you can add your own resolvers by overriding the repositoriesTask task in the module: build.sc import coursier.maven.MavenRepository def repositoriesTask = T.task { super.repositoriesTask() ++ Seq( MavenRepository(\"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases\") ) } To add custom resolvers to the initial bootstrap of the build, you can create a custom ZincWorkerModule, and override the zincWorker method in your ScalaModule by pointing it to that custom object: build.sc import coursier.maven.MavenRepository object CustomZincWorkerModule extends ZincWorkerModule with CoursierModule { def repositoriesTask() = T.task { super.repositoriesTask() ++ Seq( MavenRepository(\"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases\") ) } } object YourBuild extends ScalaModule { def zincWorker = CustomZincWorkerModule // ... rest of your build definitions } If you want to use additonal dependencies at runtime or override dependencies and their versions at runtime, you can do so with runIvyDeps. build.sc: Declaring runtime dependencies import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends JavaModule { def runIvyDeps = Agg( ivy\"ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.7\", ivy\"com.h2database:h2:2.0.202\" ) } Mill has no test-scoped dependencies! You might be used to test-scoped dependencies from other build tools like Maven, Gradle or sbt. As test modules in Mill are just regular modules, there is no special need for a dedicated test-scope. You can use ivyDeps and runIvyDeps to declare dependencies in test modules. You can also declare compile-time-only dependencies with compileIvyDeps. These are present in the compile classpath, but will not propagated to the transitive dependencies. build.sc: Delcaring compile-time-only dependencies import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends JavaModule { def compileIvyDeps = Agg( ivy\"javax.servlet:sevlet-api:2.5\" ) } Compile-time dependencies are translated to provided-scoped dependencies when publish to Maven or Ivy-Repositories. It’s always a good idea to keep your dependencies up-to-date. If your project is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can use Scala Steward to automatically open a pull request to update your dependencies whenever there is a newer version available. Scala Steward can also keep your Mill version up-to-date. build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.13.1\" object test extends Tests { def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy\"com.lihaoyi::utest:0.7.1\") def testFramework = \"utest.runner.Framework\" } } For convenience, you can also use one of the predefined test frameworks: TestModule.Junit4 TestModule.Junit5 TestModule.TestNg TestModule.Munit TestModule.ScalaTest TestModule.Specs2 TestModule.Utest build.sc: ScalaModule with UTest tests using the predefined TestModule.Utest import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.13.1\" object test extends Tests with TestModule.Utest { def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy\"com.lihaoyi::utest:0.7.1\") } } Example 3 You can define a test suite by creating a nested module extending Tests, and specifying the ivy coordinates and name of your test framework. This expects the tests to be laid out as follows: build.sc foo/ src/ Example.scala resources/ ... test/ src/ ExampleTest.scala resources/ ... out/ foo/ ... test/ ... The above example can be run via mill foo.test By default, tests are run in a subprocess, and forkArg and forkEnv can be overridden to pass JVM flags & environment variables. You can also use mill foo.test.testLocal To run tests in-process in an isolated classloader. If you want to pass any arguments to the test framework, simply put them after foo.test in the command line. e.g. uTest lets you pass in a selector to decide which test to run, which in Mill would be: mill foo.test foo.MyTestSuite.testCaseName You can define multiple test suites if you want, e.g.: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" object test extends Tests with TestModule.Utest { def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy\"com.lihaoyi::utest:0.6.0\") } object integration extends Tests with TestModule.Utest { def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy\"com.lihaoyi::utest:0.6.0\") } } Each of which will expect their sources to be in their respective foo/test and foo/integration folder. Tests modules are ScalaModules like any other, and all the same configuration options apply. Integrating with test frameworks like Scalatest or specs2 is simply a matter of adding it to ivyDeps and specifying the testFramework you want to use. Scalatest example: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" object test extends Tests with TestModule.ScalaTest { def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy\"org.scalatest::scalatest:3.0.4\") } } Specs2 example: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" object test extends Tests with TestModule.Specs2 { def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy\"org.specs2::specs2-core:4.6.0\") } } After that, you can follow the instructions in Adding a Test Suite, and use mill foo.test as usual, or pass args to the test suite via mill foo.test arg1 arg2 arg3. build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def compileIvyDeps = Agg(ivy\"com.lihaoyi:::acyclic:0.1.7\") def scalacOptions = Seq(\"-P:acyclic:force\") def scalacPluginIvyDeps = Agg(ivy\"com.lihaoyi:::acyclic:0.1.7\") } You can use Scala compiler plugins by setting scalacPluginIvyDeps. The above example also adds the plugin to compileIvyDeps, since that plugin’s artifact is needed on the compilation classpath (though not at runtime). Remember that compiler plugins are published against the full Scala version (eg. 2.13.8 instead of just 2.13), so when including them make sure to use the ::: syntax shown above in the example. Mill supports code formatting via scalafmt out of the box. To have a formatting per-module you need to make your module extend mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._, scalafmt._ object foo extends ScalaModule with ScalafmtModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" } Now you can reformat code with mill foo.reformat command, or only check for misformatted files with mill foo.checkFormat. You can also reformat your project’s code globally with mill mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule/reformatAll __.sources command, or only check the code’s format with mill mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule/checkFormatAll __.sources. It will reformat all sources that matches __.sources query. If you add a .scalafmt.conf file at the root of you project, it will be used to configure formatting. It can contain a version key to specify the scalafmt version used to format your code. See the scalafmt configuration documentation for details. build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ trait CommonModule extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" } object foo extends CommonModule object bar extends CommonModule { def moduleDeps = Seq(foo) } You can extract out configuration common to multiple modules into a trait that those modules extend. This is useful for providing convenience & ensuring consistent configuration: every module often has the same scala-version, uses the same testing framework, etc. and all that can be extracted out into the trait. Mill builds on ammonite which allows you to define global configuration. Depending on how you start mill, one of two files will be loaded. For the build REPL (--repl or -i without specifying a target), ~/.mill/ammonite/predef.sc will be loaded, and for builds from the command line the file ~/.mill/ammonite/predefScript.sc will be included. You might want to create a symlink from one to the other to avoid duplication. Example ~/.mill/ammonite/predef.sc ~/.mill/ammonite/predef.sc val nexusUser = \"myuser\" val nexusPassword = \"mysecret\" Everything declared in the above file will be available to any build you run. def repositories = super.repositories ++ Seq( // login and pass are globally configured MavenRepository(\"https://nexus.mycompany.com/repository/maven-releases\", authentication = Some(coursier.core.Authentication(nexusUser, nexusPassword))) ) build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" } def lineCount = T { foo.sources().flatMap(ref => os.walk(ref.path)).filter(os.isFile).flatMap(os.read.lines).size } def printLineCount() = T.command { println(lineCount()) } You can define new cached Targets using the T {…​} syntax, depending on existing Targets e.g. foo.sources via the foo.sources() syntax to extract their current value, as shown in lineCount above. The return-type of a Target has to be JSON-serializable (using uPickle) and the Target is cached when first run until its inputs change (in this case, if someone edits the foo.sources files which live in foo/src. Cached Targets cannot take parameters. You can print the value of your custom target using show, e.g. mill show lineCount You can define new un-cached Commands using the T.command {…​} syntax. These are un-cached and re-evaluate every time you run them, but can take parameters. Their return type needs to be JSON-writable as well, or (): Unit if you want to return nothing. Your custom targets can depend on each other using the def bar = T {…​ foo() …​} syntax, and you can create arbitrarily long chains of dependent targets. Mill will handle the re-evaluation and caching of the targets' output for you, and will provide you a T.dest folder for you to use as scratch space or to store files you want to return. Custom targets and commands can contain arbitrary code. Whether you want to download files (e.g. using mill.modules.Util.download), shell-out to Webpack to compile some Javascript, generate sources to feed into a compiler, or create some custom jar/zip assembly with the files you want (e.g. using mill.modules.Jvm.createJar), all of these can simply be custom targets with your code running in the T {…​} block. build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object qux extends Module { object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" } object bar extends ScalaModule { def moduleDeps = Seq(foo) def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" } } Not every Module needs to be a ScalaModule; sometimes you just want to group things together for neatness. In the above example, you can run foo and bar namespaced inside qux: mill qux.foo.compile mill qux.bar.run You can also define your own module traits, with their own set of custom tasks, to represent other things e.g. Javascript bundles, docker image building,: build.sc trait MySpecialModule extends Module { ... } object foo extends MySpecialModule object bar extends MySpecialModule build.sc import mill._ import mill.scalalib._ object `hyphenated-module` extends Module { def `hyphenated-target` = T{ println(\"This is a hyphenated target in a hyphenated module.\") } } object unhyphenatedModule extends Module { def unhyphenated_target = T{ println(\"This is an unhyphenated target in an unhyphenated module.\") } def unhyphenated_target2 = T{ println(\"This is the second unhyphenated target in an unhyphenated module.\") } } Mill modules and tasks may be composed of the following character types: Alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9) Underscore (_) Hyphen (-) Due to Scala naming restrictions, module and task names with hyphens must be surrounded by back-ticks (`). Using hyphenated names at the command line is unaffected by these restrictions. mill hyphenated-module.hyphenated-target mill unhyphenatedModule.unhyphenated_target mill unhyphenatedModule.unhyphenated_target2 build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def compile = T { println(\"Compiling...\") super.compile() } def run(args: String*) = T.command { println(\"Running...\" + args.mkString(\" \")) super.run(args:_*) } } You can re-define targets and commands to override them, and use super if you want to refer to the originally defined task. The above example shows how to override compile and run to add additional logging messages, but you can also override ScalaModule#generatedSources to feed generated code to your compiler, ScalaModule#prependShellScript to make your assemblies executable, or ScalaModule#console to use the Ammonite REPL instead of the normal Scala REPL. In Mill builds the override keyword is optional. build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def unmanagedClasspath = T { if (!os.exists(millSourcePath / \"lib\")) Agg() else Agg.from(os.list(millSourcePath / \"lib\").map(PathRef(_))) } } You can override unmanagedClasspath to point it at any jars you place on the filesystem, e.g. in the above snippet any jars that happen to live in the foo/lib/ folder. build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def mainClass = Some(\"foo.bar.Baz\") } Mill’s foo.run by default will discover which main class to run from your compilation output, but if there is more than one or the main class comes from some library you can explicitly specify which one to use. This also adds the main class to your foo.jar and foo.assembly jars. When you make a runnable jar of your project with assembly command, you may want to exclude some files from a final jar (like signature files, and manifest files from library jars), and merge duplicated files (for instance reference.conf files from library dependencies). By default mill excludes all *.sf, *.dsa, *.rsa, and META-INF/MANIFEST.MF files from assembly, and concatenates all reference.conf files. You can also define your own merge/exclude rules. build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ import mill.modules.Assembly._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def assemblyRules = Seq( Rule.Append(\"application.conf\"), // all application.conf files will be concatenated into single file Rule.AppendPattern(\".*\\\\.conf\"), // all *.conf files will be concatenated into single file Rule.ExcludePattern(\"*.temp\"), // all *.temp files will be excluded from a final jar Rule.Relocate(\"shapeless.**\", \"shade.shapless.@1\") // the `shapeless` package will be shaded under the `shade` package ) } build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.4\" def unmanagedClasspath = Agg( mill.modules.Util.download( \"https://github.com/williamfiset/FastJavaIO/releases/download/v1.0/fastjavaio.jar\", os.rel / \"fastjavaio.jar\" ) ) } You can also override unmanagedClasspath to point it at jars that you want to download from arbitrary URLs. Note that targets like unmanagedClasspath are cached, so your jar is downloaded only once and re-used indefinitely after that. All ScalaModules have a console and a repl target, to start a Scala console or an Ammonite Repl. To use the latter, you can (and sometimes need to) customize the Ammonite version to work with your selected Scala version. The default Ammonite version is the one, which is used by Mill internally (Mill’s build.sc is an Ammonite script, after all). But depending on the Scala version you are using, there is probably no matching Ammonite release available. In order to start the repl, you have to specify a different available Ammonite version. Example: Overriding ammoniteVersion to select a release compatible to the scalaVersion import mill._. scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.12.6\" def ammoniteVersion = \"2.4.0\" } Why is Ammonite tied to the exact Scala version? This is because Ammonite depends on the Scala compiler. In contrast to the Scala library, compiler releases do not guarantee any binary compatibility between releases. As a consequence, Ammonite needs full Scala version specific releases. The older your used Mill version or the newer the Scala version you want to use, the higher is the risk that the default Ammonite version will not match.","title":"Configuring Mill","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Configuring_Mill","url":"/mill/Configuring_Mill.html","titles":[{"text":"Compilation & Execution Flags","hash":"_compilation_execution_flags","id":1},{"text":"Adding Ivy Dependencies","hash":"_adding_ivy_dependencies","id":2},{"text":"Repository configuration","hash":"_repository_configuration","id":3},{"text":"Runtime and compile-time dependencies","hash":"_runtime_and_compile_time_dependencies","id":4},{"text":"Keeping up-to-date with Scala Steward","hash":"_keeping_up_to_date_with_scala_steward","id":5},{"text":"Adding a Test Suite","hash":"_adding_a_test_suite","id":6},{"text":"Custom Test Frameworks","hash":"_custom_test_frameworks","id":7},{"text":"Scala Compiler Plugins","hash":"_scala_compiler_plugins","id":8},{"text":"Reformatting your code","hash":"_reformatting_your_code","id":9},{"text":"Common Configuration","hash":"_common_configuration","id":10},{"text":"Global configuration","hash":"_global_configuration","id":11},{"text":"Custom Tasks","hash":"_custom_tasks","id":12},{"text":"Custom Modules","hash":"_custom_modules","id":13},{"text":"Module/Task Names","hash":"_moduletask_names","id":14},{"text":"Overriding Tasks","hash":"_overriding_tasks","id":15},{"text":"Unmanaged Jars","hash":"_unmanaged_jars","id":16},{"text":"Defining a Main Class","hash":"_defining_a_main_class","id":17},{"text":"Merge/exclude/relocate files from assembly","hash":"_mergeexcluderelocate_files_from_assembly","id":18},{"text":"Downloading Non-Maven Jars","hash":"_downloading_non_maven_jars","id":19},{"text":"Using the Ammonite Repl / Scala console","hash":"_using_the_ammonite_repl_scala_console","id":20}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"The plugins in this section are developed/maintained in the mill git tree.

You can use this as follows: object foo extends mill.Cross[FooModule](\"2.10\", \"2.11\", \"2.12\") class FooModule(crossVersion: String) extends Module { def suffix = T { crossVersion } def bigSuffix = T { suffix().toUpperCase() } } This defines three copies of FooModule: \"210\", \"211\" and \"212\", each of which has their own suffix target. You can then run them via mill show foo[2.10].suffix mill show foo[2.10].bigSuffix mill show foo[2.11].suffix mill show foo[2.11].bigSuffix mill show foo[2.12].suffix mill show foo[2.12].bigSuffix Please be aware that some shells like zsh interpret square brackets differently, so quoting or masking might be needed. mill show foo\\[2.10\\].suffix mill show 'foo[2.10].suffix' mill show \"foo[2.10].suffix\" The modules each also have a millSourcePath of foo/2.10 foo/2.11 foo/2.12 And the suffix targets will have the corresponding output paths for their metadata and files: foo/2.10/suffix foo/2.10/bigSuffix foo/2.11/suffix foo/2.11/bigSuffix foo/2.12/suffix foo/2.12/bigSuffix You can also have a cross-build with multiple inputs: val crossMatrix = for { crossVersion <- Seq(\"210\", \"211\", \"212\") platform <- Seq(\"jvm\", \"js\", \"native\") if !(platform == \"native\" && crossVersion != \"212\") } yield (crossVersion, platform) object foo extends mill.Cross[FooModule](crossMatrix:_*) class FooModule(crossVersion: String, platform: String) extends Module { def suffix = T { crossVersion + \"_\" + platform } } Here, we define our cross-values programmatically using a for-loop that spits out tuples instead of individual values. Our FooModule template class then takes two parameters instead of one. This creates the following modules each with their own suffix target: mill show foo[210,jvm].suffix mill show foo[211,jvm].suffix mill show foo[212,jvm].suffix mill show foo[210,js].suffix mill show foo[211,js].suffix mill show foo[212,js].suffix mill show foo[212,native].suffix You can refer to targets defined in cross-modules as follows: object foo extends mill.Cross[FooModule](\"2.10\", \"2.11\", \"2.12\") class FooModule(crossVersion: String) extends Module { def suffix = T { crossVersion } } def bar = T { \"hello \" + foo(\"2.10\").suffix } Here, foo(\"2.10\") references the \"2.10\" instance of FooModule. You can refer to whatever versions of the cross-module you want, even using multiple versions of the cross-module in the same target: object foo extends mill.Cross[FooModule](\"2.10\", \"2.11\", \"2.12\") class FooModule(crossVersion: String) extends Module { def suffix = T { crossVersion } } def bar = T { \"hello \" + foo(\"2.10\").suffix + \" world \" + foo(\"2.12\").suffix } Targets in cross-modules can depend on one another the same way that external targets: object foo extends mill.Cross[FooModule](\"2.10\", \"2.11\", \"2.12\") class FooModule(crossVersion: String) extends Module { def suffix = T { crossVersion } } object bar extends mill.Cross[BarModule](\"2.10\", \"2.11\", \"2.12\") class BarModule(crossVersion: String) extends Module { def bigSuffix = T { foo(crossVersion).suffix().toUpperCase() } } Here, you can run: mill show foo[2.10].suffix mill show foo[2.11].suffix mill show foo[2.12].suffix mill show bar[2.10].bigSuffix mill show bar[2.11].bigSuffix mill show bar[2.12].bigSuffix You can define an implicit mill.define.Cross.Resolver within your cross-modules, which would let you use a shorthand foo() syntax when referring to other cross-modules with an identical set of cross values: trait MyModule extends Module { def crossVersion: String implicit object resolver extends mill.define.Cross.Resolver[MyModule] { def resolve[V <: MyModule](c: Cross[V]): V = c.itemMap(List(crossVersion)) } } object foo extends mill.Cross[FooModule](\"2.10\", \"2.11\", \"2.12\") class FooModule(val crossVersion: String) extends MyModule { def suffix = T { crossVersion } } object bar extends mill.Cross[BarModule](\"2.10\", \"2.11\", \"2.12\") class BarModule(val crossVersion: String) extends MyModule { def longSuffix = T { \"_\" + foo().suffix() } } While the example resolver simply looks up the target Cross value for the cross-module instance with the same crossVersion, you can make the resolver arbitrarily complex. E.g. the resolver for mill.scalalib.CrossSbtModule looks for a cross-module instance whose scalaVersion is binary compatible (e.g. 2.10.5 is compatible with 2.10.3) with the current cross-module.","title":"Cross Builds","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Cross_Builds","url":"/mill/Cross_Builds.html","titles":[{"text":"Defining Cross Modules","hash":"_defining_cross_modules","id":1},{"text":"Using Cross Modules from Outside","hash":"_using_cross_modules_from_outside","id":2},{"text":"Using Cross Modules from other Cross Modules","hash":"_using_cross_modules_from_other_cross_modules","id":3},{"text":"Cross Resolvers","hash":"_cross_resolvers","id":4}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"There are different ways of extending Mill, depending on how much customization and flexibility you need. This page will go through your options from the easiest/least-flexible to the hardest/most-flexible. The simplest way of adding custom functionality to Mill is to define a custom Target or Command: def foo = T { ... } def bar(x: Int, s: String) = T.command { ... } These can depend on other Targets, contain arbitrary code, and be placed top-level or within any module. If you have something you just want to do that isn’t covered by the built-in ScalaModules/ScalaJSModules, simply write a custom Target (for cached computations) or Command (for un-cached actions) and you’re done. For subprocess/filesystem operations, you can use the os-lib library that comes bundled with Mill, or even plain java.nio/java.lang.Process. Each target gets its own T.dest folder that you can use to place files without worrying about colliding with other targets. This covers use cases like: def doWebpackStuff(sources: Seq[PathRef]): PathRef = ??? def javascriptSources = T.sources { millSourcePath / \"js\" } def compiledJavascript = T { doWebpackStuff(javascriptSources()) } object foo extends ScalaModule { def runClasspath = T { super.runClasspath() ++ compiledJavascript() } } object foo extends ScalaModule {} def deploy(assembly: PathRef, credentials: String) = ??? def deployFoo(credentials: String) = T.command { deploy(foo.assembly(), credentials) } Custom Targets & Commands are re-computed from scratch each time; sometimes you want to keep values around in-memory when using --watch or the Build REPL. E.g. you may want to keep a webpack process running so webpack’s own internal caches are hot and compilation is fast: def webpackWorker = T.worker { // Spawn a process using java.lang.Process and return it } def javascriptSources = T.sources { millSourcePath / \"js\" } def doWebpackStuff(webpackProcess: Process, sources: Seq[PathRef]): PathRef = ??? def compiledJavascript = T { doWebpackStuff(webpackWorker(), javascriptSources()) } Mill itself uses T.workers for its built-in Scala support: we keep the Scala compiler in memory between compilations, rather than discarding it each time, in order to improve performance. trait FooModule extends mill.Module { def bar = T { \"hello\" } def baz = T { \"world\" } } Custom modules are useful if you have a common set of tasks that you want to re-used across different parts of your build. You simply define a trait inheriting from mill.Module, and then use that trait as many times as you want in various objects: object foo1 extends FooModule object foo2 extends FooModule { def qux = T { \"I am Cow\" } } You can also define a trait extending the built-in ScalaModule if you have common configuration you want to apply to all your ScalaModules: trait FooModule extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.11.11\" object test extends Tests with TestModule.ScalaTest { def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy\"org.scalatest::scalatest:3.0.4\") } } If you want to define some functionality that can be used both inside and outside the build, you can create a new foo.sc file next to your build.sc, import $file.foo, and use it in your build.sc file: foo.sc def fooValue() = 31337 build.sc import $file.foo def printFoo() = T.command { println(foo.fooValue()) } Mill’s import $file syntax supports the full functionality of Ammonite Scripts If you want to pull in artifacts from the public repositories (e.g. Maven Central) for use in your build, you can simply use import $ivy. Example build.sc: Using scalatags library to generate HTML import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::scalatags:0.6.2` (1) def generatedHtml = T { import scalatags.Text.all._ (2) html( head(), body( h1(\"Hello\"), p(\"World\") ) ).render } 1 Import the scalatags library from Mavel Central repository. 2 Creates the generatedHtml target which is used here to generate a simple Hello World HTML document. It can be used however you would like: written to a file, further processed, etc. Please also read the next section Using Mill Plugins (import $ivy)]. For more information, see Ammonite’s Ivy Dependencies documentation. Mill plugins are ordinary jars and are loaded as any other external dependency with import $ivy. Mill plugins are typically bound to a specific version or version range of Mill. To ease the use of the correct versions and avoid runtime issues (caused by binary incompatible plugins, which are hard to debug) you can apply one of the following techniques: // for classic Scala dependencies import $ivy.`::::` (1) // for dependencies specific to the exact Scala version import $ivy.`:::::` (2) 1 This is equivalent to import $ivy.`::_mill$MILL_BIN_PLATFORM:` 2 This is equivalent to import $ivy.`:::_mill$MILL_BIN_PLATFORM:` $MILL_VERSION to substitute the currently used Mill version. This is typical required for Mill contrib modules, which are developed in the Mill repository and highly bound to the current Mill version. Example: Use mill-contrib-bloop plugin matching the current Mill version import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi:mill-contrib-bloop:$MILL_VERSION` There is the even more convenient option to leave the version completely empty. Mill will substitute it with its current version. But don’t forget to provide the trailing colon! Example: Use mill-contrib-bloop plugin matching the current Mill version import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi:mill-contrib-bloop:` $MILL_BIN_PLATFORM to substitute the currently used Mill binary platform. Example: Using mill-vcs-version plugin matching the current Mill Binary Platfrom import $ivy.`de.tototec::de.tobiasroeser.mill.vcs.version_mill$MILL_BIN_PLATFORM:0.1.2` If you want to publish re-usable libraries that other people can use in their builds, simply publish your code as a library to maven central. Evaluator Command are experimental and suspected to change. See issue #502 for details. You can define a command that takes in the current Evaluator as an argument, which you can use to inspect the entire build, or run arbitrary tasks. For example, here is the mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea command which uses this to traverse the module-tree and generate an Intellij project config for your build. def idea(ev: Evaluator) = T.command { mill.scalalib.GenIdea( implicitly, ev.rootModule, ev.discover ) } Many built-in tools are implemented as custom evaluator commands: inspect, resolve, show. If you want a way to run Mill commands and programmatically manipulate the tasks and outputs, you do so with your own evaluator command.","title":"Extending Mill","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Extending_Mill","url":"/mill/Extending_Mill.html","titles":[{"text":"Custom Targets & Commands","hash":"_custom_targets_commands","id":1},{"text":"Compile some Javascript with Webpack and put it in your runtime classpath:","hash":"_compile_some_javascript_with_webpack_and_put_it_in_your_runtime_classpath","id":2},{"text":"Deploy your compiled assembly to AWS","hash":"_deploy_your_compiled_assembly_to_aws","id":3},{"text":"Custom Workers","hash":"_custom_workers","id":4},{"text":"Custom Modules","hash":"_custom_modules","id":5},{"text":"import $file","hash":"_import_file","id":6},{"text":"import $ivy","hash":"_import_ivy","id":7},{"text":"Using Mill Plugins (import $ivy)","hash":"_using_mill_plugins_import_ivy","id":8},{"text":"Use the specific Mill Binary Platform notation","hash":"_use_the_specific_mill_binary_platform_notation","id":9},{"text":"Use special placeholders in your import $ivy","hash":"_use_special_placeholders_in_your_import_ivy","id":10},{"text":"Evaluator Commands (experimental)","hash":"_evaluator_commands_experimental","id":11}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"Mill comes bundled with a set of external Open Source libraries and projects.

Scared of SBT? Melancholy over Maven? Grumbling about Gradle? Baffled by Bazel? Give Mill a try! Mill aims for simplicity by reusing concepts you are already familiar with, borrowing ideas from modern tools like Bazel. It lets you build your projects in a way that’s simple, fast, and predictable. Mill has built-in support for the Scala programming language, and can serve as a replacement for SBT. It can be extended to support any other language or platform via modules (written in Java or Scala) or through external subprocesses. If you are using Mill, you will find the following book by the Author useful in using Mill to the fullest: https://handsonscala.com/ Installation via homebrew: brew install mill Arch Linux has a Community package for mill: pacman -S mill Installation via pkg(8): pkg install mill emerge dev-java/mill-bin To get started, download Mill from Github releases, and save it as mill.bat. If you’re using Scoop you can install Mill via scoop install mill Mill also works on \"sh\" environments on Windows (e.g., MSYS2, Cygwin, Git-Bash, WSL); to get started, follow the instructions in the Manual section below. Note that: In some environments (such as WSL), Mill might have to be run without a server (using -i, --interactive , --no-server, or --repl.) On Cygwin, run the following after downloading mill: sed -i '0,/-cp \"\\$0\"/{s/-cp \"\\$0\"/-cp `cygpath -w \"\\$0\"`/}; 0,/-cp \"\\$0\"/{s/-cp \"\\$0\"/-cp `cygpath -w \"\\$0\"`/}' /usr/local/bin/mill You can download and run a \"Docker image containing OpenJDK, Scala and Mill\" using docker pull nightscape/scala-mill docker run -it nightscape/scala-mill To get started, download Mill and install it into your system via the following curl/chmod command: sudo sh -c \"curl -L https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/releases/download/0.10.4/0.10.4 > /usr/local/bin/mill && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mill\" If you are using Mill in a codebase, you can commit the bootstrap launcher as a ./mill script in the project folder: curl -L https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/releases/download/0.10.4/0.10.4 > mill && chmod +x mill Now, anyone who wants to work with the project can simply use the ./mill script directly: ./mill version ./mill __.compile # double underscore The mill command will automatically use the version specified by the bootstrap script, even if you installed it via other means. The ./mill file has a version number embedded within it, which you can update simply by editing the script. Note this only works for versions 0.5.0 and above. Bootstrap scripts are also useful for running Mill in CI, ensuring that your Jenkins/Travis/etc. box has the correct version of Mill present to build/compile/test your code. Instead of installing Mill directly, you can also use lefou/millw as drop-in replacement for mill. It provides a small shell script and also a Windows batch file, that transparently downloads mill and executes it on your behalf. It respects various ways to configure the preferred Mill version (MILL_VERSION env var, .mill-version file, --mill-version option) and can also be used as a bootstrap script in your project. Installing mill via coursier or cs is currently not officially supported. There are various issues, especially with interactive mode. Once installed mill is able to use newer or different versions for each project automatically. You don’t need to install multiple versions of mill yourself. See section Overriding Mill Versions how to do it. The simplest Mill build for a Java project looks as follows: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends JavaModule {} The simplest Mill build for a Scala project looks as follows: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.13.8\" } Both of these would build a project laid out as follows: build.sc foo/ src/ FileA.java FileB.scala resources/ ... out/ foo/ ... You can download an example project with this layout here: Example 1 The source code for this module would live in the foo/src/ folder, matching the name you assigned to the module. Output for this module (compiled files, resolved dependency lists, …) would live in out/foo/. This can be run from the Bash shell via: $ mill foo.compile # compile sources into classfiles $ mill foo.run # run the main method, if any $ mill foo.runBackground # run the main method in the background $ mill foo.launcher # prepares a foo/launcher.dest/run you can run later $ mill foo.jar # bundle the classfiles into a jar $ mill foo.assembly # bundle classfiles and all dependencies into a jar $ mill -i foo.console # start a Scala console within your project (in interactive mode: \"-i\") $ mill -i foo.repl # start an Ammonite REPL within your project (in interactive mode: \"-i\") You can run mill resolve __ to see a full list of the different tasks that are available, mill resolve foo._ to see the tasks within foo, mill inspect foo.compile to inspect a task’s doc-comment documentation or what it depends on, or mill show foo.scalaVersion to show the output of any task. The most common tasks that Mill can run are cached targets, such as compile, and un-cached commands such as foo.run. Targets do not re-evaluate unless one of their inputs changes, whereas commands re-run every time. Mill puts all its output in the top-level out/ folder. The above commands would end up in: out/ foo/ compile.dest compile.log compile.json run.dest run.log run.json runBackground.dest runBackground.log runBackground.json launcher.dest launcher.log launcher.json jar.dest jar.log jar.json assembly.dest assembly.log assembly.json For each task there’s a foo.json file containing the metadata returned by that task, and two optional paths: a foo.dest/ folder containing any files that the task generates and a foo.log file containing the the logs of running that task. For example, out/foo/compile.dest/ contains the compiled classfiles, while out/foo/assembly.dest/ contains the self-contained assembly with the project’s classfiles jar-ed up with all its dependencies. Given a task foo.bar, all its output and results are inside its respective out/foo/bar/ folder. build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends JavaModule object bar extends JavaModule { def moduleDeps = Seq(foo) } build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.13.8\" } object bar extends ScalaModule { def moduleDeps = Seq(foo) def scalaVersion = \"2.13.8\" } You can define multiple modules the same way you define a single module, using def moduleDeps to define the relationship between them. The above builds expect the following project layout: build.sc foo/ src/ Main.scala resources/ ... bar/ src/ Main2.scala resources/ ... out/ foo/ ... bar/ ... And can be built/run using: $ mill foo.compile $ mill bar.compile $ mill foo.run $ mill bar.run $ mill foo.jar $ mill bar.jar $ mill foo.assembly $ mill bar.assembly Mill’s evaluator will ensure that the modules are compiled in the right order, and recompiled as necessary when source code in each module changes. Modules can also be nested: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.13.8\" object bar extends ScalaModule { def moduleDeps = Seq(foo) def scalaVersion = \"2.13.8\" } } Which would result in a similarly nested project layout: build.sc foo/ src/ Main.scala resources/ ... bar/ src/ Main2.scala resources/ ... out/ foo/ ... bar/ ... Where the nested modules can be run via: $ mill foo.compile $ mill foo.bar.compile $ mill foo.run $ mill foo.bar.run $ mill foo.jar $ mill foo.bar.jar $ mill foo.assembly $ mill foo.bar.assembly You can use the --watch flag to make Mill watch a task’s inputs, re-evaluating the task as necessary when the inputs change: $ mill --watch foo.compile $ mill --watch foo.run $ mill -w foo.compile $ mill -w foo.run Mill’s --watch flag watches both the files you are building using Mill, as well as Mill’s own build.sc file and anything it imports, so any changes to your build.sc will automatically get picked up. For long-running processes like web servers, you can use runBackground to make sure they recompile and restart when code changes, forcefully terminating the previous process even though it may be still alive: $ mill -w foo.compile $ mill -w foo.runBackground By default, mill will evaluate all tasks in sequence. But mill also supports processing tasks in parallel. This feature is currently experimental and we encourage you to report any issues you find on our bug tracker. To enable parallel task execution, use the --jobs (-j) option followed by a number of maximal parallel threads. Example: Use up to 4 parallel threads to compile all modules: mill -j 4 __.compile To use as many threads as your machine has (logical) processor cores use --jobs 0. To disable parallel execution use --jobs 1. This is currently the default. Please note that the maximal possible parallelism depends on your project. Tasks that depend on each other can’t be processed in parallel. Mill is a command-line tool and supports various options. Run mill --help for a complete list of options Output of mill --help Mill Build Tool usage: mill [options] [[target [target-options]] [+ [target ...]]] --no-default-predef Disable the default predef and run Ammonite with the minimal predef possible -s --silent Make ivy logs go silent instead of printing though failures will still throw exception -w --watch Watch and re-run your scripts when they change --bsp Run a BSP server against the passed scripts -c --code Pass in code to be run immediately in the REPL -h --home The home directory of the REPL; where it looks for config and caches -p --predef Lets you load your predef from a custom location, rather than the \"default location in your Ammonite home --color Enable or disable colored output; by default colors are enabled in both REPL and scripts if the console is interactive, and disabled otherwise --thin Hide parts of the core of Ammonite and some of its dependencies.

Use 1 to disable parallel and 0 to use as much threads as available processors. rest ... The name of the targets you want to build, followed by any parameters you wish to pass to those targets. All options must be given before the first target. A target is a fully qualified task or command optionally followed by target specific arguments. You can use wildcards and brace-expansion to select multiple targets at once or to shorten the path to deeply nested targets. If you provide optional target arguments and your wildcard or brace-expansion is resolved to multiple targets, the arguments will be applied to each of the targets. Table 1. Wildcards and brace-expansion Wildcard Function _ matches a single segment of the target path __ matches arbitrary segments of the target path {a,b} is equal to specifying two targets a and b You can use the + symbol to add another target with optional arguments. If you need to feed a + as argument to your target, you can mask it by preceding it with a backslash (\\). mill foo._.compile Runs compile for all direct sub-modules of foo mill foo.__.test Runs test for all sub-modules of foo mill {foo,bar}.__.testCached Runs testCached for all sub-modules of foo and bar mill __.compile + foo.__.test Runs all compile targets and all tests under foo. Mill comes with a few useful command-line utilities built into it: $ mill resolve _ [1/1] resolve clean foo inspect par path plan resolve show shutdown version visualize visualizePlan $ mill resolve _.compile [1/1] resolve foo.compile $ mill resolve foo._ [1/1] resolve foo.allSourceFiles foo.allSources foo.ammoniteReplClasspath foo.ammoniteVersion foo.artifactId foo.artifactName ... resolve lists the tasks that match a particular query, without running them. This is useful for \"dry running\" an mill command to see what would be run before you run them, or to explore what modules or tasks are available from the command line using resolve _, resolve foo._, etc. mill resolve foo.{compile,run} mill resolve \"foo.{compile,run}\" mill resolve foo.compile foo.run mill resolve _.compile # list the compile tasks for every top-level module mill resolve __.compile # list the compile tasks for every module mill resolve _ # list every top level module and task mill resolve foo._ # list every task directly within the foo module mill resolve __ # list every module and task recursively $ mill inspect foo.run [1/1] inspect foo.run(JavaModule.scala:442) Runs this module's code in a subprocess and waits for it to finish Inputs: foo.finalMainClass foo.runClasspath foo.forkArgs foo.forkEnv foo.forkWorkingDir inspect is a more verbose version of resolve. In addition to printing out the name of one-or-more tasks, it also displays its source location and a list of input tasks. This is very useful for debugging and interactively exploring the structure of your build from the command line. inspect also works with the same _/__ wildcard/query syntaxes that resolve do: mill inspect foo.compile mill inspect foo.{compile,run} mill inspect \"foo.{compile,run}\" mill inspect foo.compile foo.run mill inspect _.compile mill inspect __.compile mill inspect _ mill inspect foo._ mill inspect __ $ mill show foo.scalaVersion [1/1] show \"2.13.1\" By default, Mill does not print out the metadata from evaluating a task. Most people would not be interested in e.g. viewing the metadata related to incremental compilation: they just want to compile their code! However, if you want to inspect the build to debug problems, you can make Mill show you the metadata output for a task using the show command: show is not just for showing configuration values. All tasks return values that can be shown with show. E.g. compile returns the paths to the classes folder and analysisFile file produced by the compilation: $ mill show foo.compile [1/1] show [10/25] foo.resources { \"analysisFile\": \"/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test//out/foo/compile.dest/zinc\", \"classes\": \"ref:07960649:/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test//out/foo/compile.dest/classes\" } show is generally useful as a debugging tool, to see what is going on in your build: $ mill show foo.sources [1/1] show [1/1] foo.sources [ \"ref:8befb7a8:/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/foo/src\" ] $ mill show foo.compileClasspath [1/1] show [2/11] foo.resources [ \"ref:c984eca8:/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/foo/resources\", \".../org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.1/scala-library-2.13.1.jar\" ] show is also useful for interacting with Mill from external tools, since the JSON it outputs is structured and easily parsed and manipulated. When show is used with multiple targets, its output will slightly change to a JSON array, containing all the results of the given targets. $ mill show \"foo.{sources,compileClasspath}\" [1/1] show [2/11] foo.resources [ [ \"ref:8befb7a8:/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/foo/src\" ], [ \"ref:c984eca8:/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/foo/resources\", \".../org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.1/scala-library-2.13.1.jar\" ] ] Same as show, but the output will always be structured in a JSON dictionary, with the task names as key and the task results as JSON values. $ mill showNamed \"foo.{sources,compileClasspath}\" [1/1] show [2/11] foo.resources { \"foo.sources\": [ \"ref:8befb7a8:/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/foo/src\" ], \"foo.compileClasspath\": [ \"ref:c984eca8:/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/foo/resources\", \".../org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.1/scala-library-2.13.1.jar\" ] } $ mill path foo.assembly foo.sources [1/1] path foo.sources foo.allSources foo.allSourceFiles foo.compile foo.localClasspath foo.assembly mill path prints out a dependency chain between the first task and the second. It is very useful for exploring the build graph and trying to figure out how data gets from one task to another. If there are multiple possible dependency chains, one of them is picked arbitrarily. $ mill plan foo.compileClasspath [1/1] plan foo.transitiveLocalClasspath foo.resources foo.unmanagedClasspath foo.scalaVersion foo.platformSuffix foo.compileIvyDeps foo.scalaOrganization foo.scalaLibraryIvyDeps foo.ivyDeps foo.transitiveIvyDeps foo.compileClasspath mill plan foo shows which tasks would be evaluated, and in what order, if you ran mill foo, but without actually running them. This is a useful tool for debugging your build: e.g. if you suspect a task foo is running things that it shouldn’t be running, a quick mill plan will list out all the upstream tasks that foo needs to run, and you can then follow up with mill path on any individual upstream task to see exactly how foo depends on it. $ mill show visualize foo._ [1/1] show [3/3] visualize [ \".../out/visualize.dest/out.txt\", \".../out/visualize.dest/out.dot\", \".../out/visualize.dest/out.json\", \".../out/visualize.dest/out.png\", \".../out/visualize.dest/out.svg\" ] mill show visualize takes a subset of the Mill build graph (e.g. core._ is every task directly under the core module) and draws out their relationships in .svg and .png form for you to inspect. It also generates .txt, .dot and .json for easy processing by downstream tools. The above command generates the following diagram: $ mill show visualizePlan foo.compile [1/1] show [3/3] visualizePlan [ \".../out/visualizePlan.dest/out.txt\", \".../out/visualizePlan.dest/out.dot\", \".../out/visualizePlan.dest/out.json\", \".../out/visualizePlan.dest/out.png\", \".../out/visualizePlan.dest/out.svg\" ] mill show visualizePlan is similar to mill show visualize except that it shows a graph of the entire build plan, including tasks not directly resolved by the query. Tasks directly resolved are shown with a solid border, and dependencies are shown with a dotted border. The above command generates the following diagram: Another use case is to view the relationships between modules. For the following two modules: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.13.1\" } object bar extends ScalaModule { def moduleDeps = Seq(foo) def scalaVersion = \"2.13.1\" } mill show visualizePlan _.compile diagrams the relationships between the compile tasks of each module, which illustrates which module depends on which other module’s compilation output: $ mill clean clean deletes all the cached outputs of previously executed tasks. It can apply to the entire project, entire modules, or specific tasks. mill clean # clean all outputs mill clean foo # clean all outputs for module 'foo' (including nested modules) mill clean foo.compile # only clean outputs for task 'compile' in module 'foo' mill clean foo.{compile,run} mill clean \"foo.{compile,run}\" mill clean foo.compile foo.run mill clean _.compile mill clean __.compile $ mill mill.scalalib.Dependency/showUpdates Mill can search for updated versions of your project’s dependencies, if available from your project’s configured repositories. Note that it uses heuristics based on common versioning schemes, so it may not work as expected for dependencies with particularly weird version numbers. Current limitations: Only works for JavaModule modules (including ScalaModules, CrossScalaModules, etc.) and Maven repositories. Always applies to all modules in the build. Doesn’t apply to $ivy dependencies used in the build definition itself. mill mill.scalalib.Dependency/showUpdates mill mill.scalalib.Dependency/showUpdates --allowPreRelease true # also show pre-release versions To support various IDEs and Language Servers, Mill supports the Build Server Protocol in version 2.0.0 and has a built-in BSP server. In addition to BSP, Mill also supports IntelliJ IDEA project configuration generation directly. To install a BSP connection file .bsp/mill-bsp.json, run: mill mill.bsp.BSP/install Working known clients of the BSP server are IntelliJ IDEA and Metals. You can fine control some BSP server options by specifying command options: Option Description --jobs n Use n threads in parallel to run tasks. A value of 0 means use as much threads as the system has cpu cores. When using Metals by default Bloop will be used as your build server unless you explicitly choose Mill. When in a Mill workspace use the \"Switch Build Server\" command from Metals which will allow you to switch to using Mill as your build server. If no .bsp/mill-bsp.json file exists Metals will automatically create it for you and then connect to Mill. If you want to use Metals, you may also want to enable SemanticDB support. Without it, some functionality like find references may not work. We still work on a better and automatic SemanticDB support. Until we have completed it, you can enable SemanticDB manually in your ScalaModule. For convenience, you can mix-in the mill.scalalib.bsp.ScalaMetalsSupport trait. This enables SemanticDB and also adapts the scalac options to produce more helpful messages in Metals. build.sc: Mix-in of ScalaMetalsSupport trait import mill._ import mill.scalalib._ import mill.scalalib.bsp.ScalaMetalsSupport object foo extends ScalaModule with ScalaMetalsSupport { def semanticDbVersion = \"4.4.32\" def scalaVersion = \"2.13.8\" } If you wish to use Bloop as your build server (it is the default metals BSP implementation) with metals / vscode, consider using the mill bloop plugin. Bloop Plugin This is preferred to the instructions (currently) on the bloop website. To generate IntelliJ IDEA project files into .idea/, run: mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea $ mill --repl Loading... @ foo res0: foo.type = ammonite.predef.build#foo:4 Commands: .ideaJavaModuleFacets(ideaConfigVersion: Int)() .ideaConfigFiles(ideaConfigVersion: Int)() .ivyDepsTree(inverse: Boolean, withCompile: Boolean, withRuntime: Boolean)() .runLocal(args: String*)() .run(args: String*)() .runBackground(args: String*)() .runMainBackground(mainClass: String, args: String*)() .runMainLocal(mainClass: String, args: String*)() .runMain(mainClass: String, args: String*)() .console()() .repl(replOptions: String*)() Targets: ... @ foo.compile res1: mill.package.T[mill.scalalib.api.CompilationResult] = foo.compile(ScalaModule.scala:143) Compiles the current module to generate compiled classfiles/bytecode Inputs: foo.upstreamCompileOutput foo.allSourceFiles foo.compileClasspath ... @ foo.compile() [25/25] foo.compile res2: mill.scalalib.api.CompilationResult = CompilationResult( /Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/out/foo/compile.dest/zinc, PathRef(/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/out/foo/compile.dest/classes, false, -61934706) ) You can run mill --repl to open a build REPL; this is a Scala console with your build.sc loaded, which lets you run tasks interactively. The task-running syntax is slightly different from the command-line, but more in line with how you would depend on tasks from within your build file. You can use this REPL to interactively explore your build to see what is available. The two most common things to do once your code is complete is to make an assembly (e.g. for deployment/installation) or publishing (e.g. to Maven Central). Mill comes with both capabilities built in. Mill comes with the built-in with the ability to make assemblies. Given a simple Mill build: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._ object foo extends ScalaModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.13.1\" } You can make a self-contained assembly via: $ mill foo.assembly $ ls -lh out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar -rw-r--r-- 1 lihaoyi staff 5.0M Feb 17 11:14 out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar You can then move the out.jar file anywhere you would like, and run it standalone using java: $ java -cp out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar foo.Example Hello World! To publish to Maven Central, you need to make foo also extend Mill’s PublishModule trait: build.sc import mill._, scalalib._, publish._ object foo extends ScalaModule with PublishModule { def scalaVersion = \"2.13.1\" def publishVersion = \"0.0.1\" def pomSettings = PomSettings( description = \"Hello\", organization = \"com.lihaoyi\", url = \"https://github.com/lihaoyi/example\", licenses = Seq(License.MIT), versionControl = VersionControl.github(\"lihaoyi\", \"example\"), developers = Seq( Developer(\"lihaoyi\", \"Li Haoyi\", \"https://github.com/lihaoyi\") ) ) } You can change the name of the published artifact (artifactId in the Maven POM) by overriding artifactName in the module you want to publish. You can download an example project with this layout here: Example 2 Which you can then publish using the mill foo.publish command, which takes your sonatype credentials ( e.g. lihaoyi:foobarbaz) and GPG password as inputs: $ mill foo.publish Missing arguments: (--sonatypeCreds: String, --release: Boolean) Arguments provided did not match expected signature: publish --sonatypeCreds String (format: \"username:password\") --signed Boolean (default true) --gpgArgs Seq[String] (default Seq(\"--batch\", \"--yes\", \"-a\", \"-b\")) --readTimeout Int (default 60000) --release Boolean (default true) --connectTimeout Int (default 5000) --awaitTimeout Int (default 120000) --stagingRelease Boolean (default true) You also need to specify release as true or false, depending on whether you just want to stage your module on oss.sonatype.org or you want Mill to complete the release process to Maven Central. If you are publishing multiple artifacts, you can also use mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll as described here The out/ folder contains all the generated files & metadata for your build. It is structured with one folder per Target/Command, that is run, e.g.: out/core/compile/ out/main/test/compile/ out/main/test/forkTest/ out/scalalib/compile/ There are also top-level build-related files in the out/ folder, prefixed as mill-*. The most useful is mill-profile.json, which logs the tasks run and time taken for the last Mill command you executed. This is very useful if you want to find out exactly what tasks are being run and Mill is being slow. Each task currently creates contains the following files: foo.dest/: optional, a path for the Task to use either as a scratch space, or to place generated files that are returned using PathRef references. A Task should only output files within its own given dest/ folder (available as T.dest) to avoid conflicting with another Task, but can name files within dest/ arbitrarily. foo.log: optional, the stdout/stderr of the Task. This is also streamed to the console during evaluation. foo.json: the cache-key and JSON-serialized return-value of the Target/Command. The return-value can also be retrieved via mill show foo.compile. Binary blobs are typically not included in foo.json, and instead stored as separate binary files in dest/ which are then referenced by foo.json via PathRef references. The out/ folder is intentionally kept simple and user-readable. If your build is not behaving as you would expect, feel free to poke around the various foo.dest/ folders to see what files are being created, or the foo.json files to see what is being returned by a particular task. You can also simply delete folders within out/ if you want to force portions of your project to be rebuilt, e.g. by deleting the out/main/ or out/main/test/compile/ folders. Apart from downloading and installing new versions of Mill globally, there are a few ways of selecting/updating your Mill version: Create a .mill-version file to specify the version of Mill you wish to use: echo \"0.5.0\" > .mill-version .mill-version takes precedence over the version of Mill specified in the ./mill script. Pass in a MILL_VERSION environment variable, e.g. MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb mill __.compile or MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb ./mill __.compile to override the Mill version manually. This takes precedence over the version specified in ./mill or .mill-version Note that both of these overrides only work for versions 0.5.0 and above. If your project is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can use Scala Steward to automatically open a pull request to update your Mill version (in .mill-version file), whenever there is a newer version available. Scala Steward can also scan your project dependencies and keep them up-to-date. In case you want to try out the latest features and improvements that are currently in the main branch, unstable versions of Mill are available as binaries named #.#.#-n-hash linked to the latest tag. Installing the latest unstable release is recommended for bootstrapping mill. The easiest way to use a development release is by updating the Bootstrap Scripts (Linux/OS-X Only), or Overriding Mill Versions via an environment variable or .mill-version file. It’s possible to pass JVM options to the Mill launcher. To do this you need to create a .mill-jvm-opts file in your project’s root. This file should contain JVM options, one per line. For example, if your build requires a lot of memory and bigger stack size, your .mill-jvm-opts could look like this: -Xss10m -Xmx10G The file name for passing JVM options to the Mill launcher is configurable. If for some reason you don’t want to use .mill-jvm-opts file name, add MILL_JVM_OPTS_PATH environment variable with any other file name.

Before working on Mill, read through that post to understand where it is coming from! Mill’s most important abstraction is the dependency graph of Tasks. Constructed using the T {…​} T.task {…​} T.command {…​} syntax, these track the dependencies between steps of a build, so those steps can be executed in the correct order, queried, or parallelized. While Mill provides helpers like ScalaModule and other things you can use to quickly instantiate a bunch of related tasks (resolve dependencies, find sources, compile, package into jar, …​) these are secondary. When Mill executes, the dependency graph is what matters: any other mode of organization (hierarchies, modules, inheritance, etc.) is only important to create this dependency graph of Tasks. The syntax for running targets from the command line mill Foo.bar.baz is the same as referencing a target in Scala code, Foo.bar.baz Everything that you can run from the command line lives in an object hierarchy in your build.sc file. Different parts of the hierarchy can have different Targets available: just add a new def foo = T {…​} somewhere and you’ll be able to run it. Cross builds, using the Cross data structure, are just another kind of node in the object hierarchy. The only difference is syntax: from the command line you’d run something via mill core.cross[a].printIt while from code you use core.cross(\"a\").printIt due to different restrictions in Scala/Bash syntax. Every Target in a build, defined by def foo = T {…​}, is cached by default. Currently this is done using a foo.json file in the out/ folder. The Target is also provided a foo.dest/ path on the filesystem dedicated to it, for it to store output files etc. This happens whether you want it to or not. Every Target is cached, not just the \"slow\" ones like compile or assembly. Caching is keyed on the .hashCode of the returned value. For Targets returning the contents of a file/folder on disk, they return PathRef instances whose hashcode is based on the hash of the disk contents. Serialization of the returned values is tentatively done using uPickle. The Mill build process is meant to be run over and over, not only as a long-lived daemon/console. That means we must minimize the startup time of the process, and that a new process must be able to re-construct the in-memory data structures where a previous process left off, in order to continue the build. Re-construction is done via the hierarchical nature of the build: each Target foo.bar.baz has a fixed position in the build hierarchy, and thus a fixed position on disk out/foo/bar/baz.json. When the old process dies and a new process starts, there will be a new instance of Target with the same implementation code and same position in the build hierarchy: this new Target can then load the out/foo/bar/baz.json file and pick up where the previous process left off. Minimizing startup time means aggressive caching, as well as minimizing the total amount of bytecode used: Mill’s current 1-2s startup time is dominated by JVM classloading. In future, we may have a long lived console or nailgun/drip-based server/client models to speed up interactive usage, but we should always keep \"cold\" startup as fast as possible. Tasks are Applicative, not Monadic. There is .map, .zip, but no .flatMap operation. That means that we can know the structure of the entire dependency graph before we start executing Tasks. This lets us perform all sorts of useful operations on the graph before running it: Given a Target the user wants to run, pre-compute and display what targets will be evaluated (\"dry run\"), without running them Automatically parallelize different parts of the dependency graph that do not depend on each other, perhaps even distributing it to different worker machines like Bazel/Pants can Visualize the dependency graph easily, e.g. by dumping to a DOT file Query the graph, e.g. \"why does this thing depend on that other thing?\" Avoid running tasks \"halfway\": if a Target’s upstream Targets fail, we can skip the Target completely rather than running halfway and then bailing out with an exception In order to avoid making people using .map and .zip all over the place when defining their Tasks, we use the T {…​}/T.task {…​}/T.command {…​} macros which allow you to use Task#apply() within the block to \"extract\" a value. def test() = T.command { TestRunner.apply( \"mill.UTestFramework\", runDepClasspath().map(_.path) :+ compile().path, Seq(compile().path) } This is roughly equivalent to the following: def test() = T.command { T.zipMap(runDepClasspath, compile, compile) { (runDepClasspath1, compile2, compile3) => TestRunner.apply( \"mill.UTestFramework\", runDepClasspath1.map(_.path) :+ compile2.path, Seq(compile3.path) ) } This is similar to SBT’s :=/.value macros, or scala-async's async/await. Like those, the T {…​} macro should let users program most of their code in a \"direct\" style and have it \"automatically\" lifted into a graph of Tasks. Why should you expect that the Mill build tool can achieve simple, easy & flexible, where other build tools in the past have failed? Build tools inherently encompass a huge number of different concepts: What \"Tasks\" depends on what? How do I define my own tasks? Where do source files come from? What needs to run in what order to do what I want? What can be parallelized and what can’t? How do tasks pass data to each other? What data do they pass? What tasks are cached? Where? How are tasks run from the command line? How do you deal with the repetition inherent in a build? (e.g. compile, run & test tasks for every \"module\") What is a \"Module\"? How do they relate to \"Tasks\"? How do you configure a Module to do something different? How are cross-builds (across different configurations) handled? These are a lot of questions to answer, and we haven’t even started talking about the actually compiling/running any code yet! If each such facet of a build was modelled separately, it’s easy to have an explosion of different concepts that would make a build tool hard to understand. Before you continue, take a moment to think: how would you answer to each of those questions using an existing build tool you are familiar with? Different tools like SBT, Fake, Gradle or Grunt have very different answers. Mill aims to provide the answer to these questions using as few, as familiar core concepts as possible. The entire Mill build is oriented around a few concepts: The Object Hierarchy The Call Graph Instantiating Traits & Classes These concepts are already familiar to anyone experienced in Scala (or any other programming language…), but are enough to answer all of the complicated build-related questions listed above. The module hierarchy is the graph of objects, starting from the root of the build.sc file, that extend mill.Module. At the leaves of the hierarchy are the Targets you can run. A Target’s position in the module hierarchy tells you many things. For example, a `Target at position core.test.compile would: Cache output metadata at out/core/test/compile.json Output files to the folder out/core/test/compile.dest/ Source files default to a folder in core/test/, core/test/src/ Be runnable from the command-line via mill core.test.compile Be referenced programmatically (from other Targets) via core.test.compile From the position of any Target within the object hierarchy, you immediately know how to run it, find its output files, find any caches, or refer to it from other Targets. You know up-front where the Targets data \"lives\" on disk, and are sure that it will never clash with any other Targets data. The Scala call graph of \"which target references which other target\" is core to how Mill operates. This graph is reified via the T {…​} macro to make it available to the Mill execution engine at runtime. The call graph tells you: Which Targets depend on which other Targets For a given Target to be built, what other Targets need to be run and in what order Which Targets can be evaluated in parallel What source files need to be watched when using --watch on a given target (by tracing the call graph up to the Sources) What a given Target makes available for other Targets to depend on (via its return value) Defining your own task that depends on others is as simple as def foo = T {…​} The call graph within your Scala code is essentially a data-flow graph: by defining a snippet of code: val b = ... val c = ... val d = ... val a = f(b, c, d) you are telling everyone that the value a depends on the values of b c and d, processed by f. A build tool needs exactly the same data structure: knowing what Target depends on what other Targets, and what processing it does on its inputs! With Mill, you can take the Scala call graph, wrap everything in the T {…​} macro, and get a Target-dependency graph that matches exactly the call-graph you already had: def b = T { ... } def c = T { ... } def d = T { ... } def a = T { f(b(), c(), d()) } Thus, if you are familiar with how data flows through a normal Scala program, you already know how data flows through a Mill build! The Mill build evaluation may be incremental, it may cache things, it may read and write from disk, but the fundamental syntax, and the data-flow that syntax represents, is unchanged from your normal Scala code. Classes and traits are a common way of re-using common data structures in Scala: if you have a bunch of fields which are related and you want to make multiple copies of those fields, you put them in a class/trait and instantiate it over and over. In Mill, inheriting from traits is the primary way for re-using common parts of a build: Scala \"project\"s with multiple related Targets within them, are just a Trait you instantiate Replacing the default Targets within a project, making them do new things or depend on new Targets, is simply override-ing them during inheritance Modifying the default Targets within a project, making use of the old value to compute the new value, is simply override`ing them and using `super.foo() Required configuration parameters within a project are abstract members Cross-builds are modelled as instantiating a (possibly anonymous) class multiple times, each instance with its own distinct set of Targets In normal Scala, you bundle up common fields & functionality into a class you can instantiate over and over, and you can override the things you want to customize. Similarly, in Mill, you bundle up common parts of a build into traits you can instantiate over and over, and you can override the things you want to customize. \"Subprojects\", \"cross-builds\", and many other concepts are reduced to simply instantiating a trait over and over, with tweaks. Mill is built as a substitute for SBT, whose problems are described here. Nevertheless, Mill takes on some parts of SBT (builds written in Scala, Task graph with an Applicative \"idiom bracket\" macro) where it makes sense. Mill is largely inspired by Bazel. In particular, the single-build-hierarchy, where every Target has an on-disk-cache/output-folder according to their position in the hierarchy, comes from Bazel. Bazel is a bit odd in its own right. The underlying data model is good (hierarchy + cached dependency graph) but getting there is hell. It (like SBT) is also a 3-layer interpretation model, but layers 1 & 2 are almost exactly the same: mutable python which performs global side effects (layer 3 is the same dependency-graph evaluator as SBT/mill). You end up having to deal with a non-trivial python codebase where everything happens via: do_something(name=\"blah\") or do_other_thing(dependencies=[\"blah\"]) where \"blah\" is a global identifier that is often constructed programmatically via string concatenation and passed around. This is quite challenging. Having the two layers be “just python” is great since people know python, but I think it’s unnecessary to have two layers (\"evaluating macros\" and \"evaluating rule impls\") that are almost exactly the same, and I think making them interact via return values rather than via a global namespace of programmatically-constructed strings would make it easier to follow. With Mill, I’m trying to collapse Bazel’s Python layer 1 & 2 into just 1 layer of Scala, and have it define its dependency graph/hierarchy by returning values, rather than by calling global-side-effecting APIs. I’ve had trouble trying to teach people how-to-bazel at work, and am pretty sure we can make something that’s easier to use. Mill’s \"direct-style\" applicative syntax is inspired by my old Scala.Rx project. While there are differences (Mill captures the dependency graph lexically using Macros, Scala.Rx captures it at runtime), they are pretty similar. The end-goal is the same: to write code in a \"direct style\" and have it automatically \"lifted\" into a dependency graph, which you can introspect and use for incremental updates at runtime. Scala.Rx is itself build upon the 2010 paper Deprecating the Observer Pattern. Mill looks a lot like CBT. The inheritance based model for customizing Modules/ScalaModules comes straight from there, as does the \"command line path matches Scala selector path\" idea. Most other things are different though: the reified dependency graph, the execution model, the caching module all follow Bazel more than they do CBT","title":"Mill Internals","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Mill_Internals","url":"/mill/Mill_Internals.html","titles":[{"text":"Mill Design Principles","hash":"_mill_design_principles","id":1},{"text":"Dependency graph first","hash":"_dependency_graph_first","id":2},{"text":"Builds are hierarchical","hash":"_builds_are_hierarchical","id":3},{"text":"Caching by default","hash":"_caching_by_default","id":4},{"text":"Short-lived build processes","hash":"_short_lived_build_processes","id":5},{"text":"Static dependency graph and Applicative tasks","hash":"_static_dependency_graph_and_applicative_tasks","id":6},{"text":"How Mill aims for Simple","hash":"_how_mill_aims_for_simple","id":7},{"text":"The Object Hierarchy","hash":"_the_object_hierarchy","id":8},{"text":"The Call Graph","hash":"_the_call_graph","id":9},{"text":"Instantiating Traits & Classes","hash":"_instantiating_traits_classes","id":10},{"text":"Prior Work","hash":"_prior_work","id":11},{"text":"SBT","hash":"_sbt","id":12},{"text":"Bazel","hash":"_bazel","id":13},{"text":"Scala.Rx","hash":"_scala_rx","id":14},{"text":"CBT","hash":"_cbt","id":15}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"Mill modules are objects extending mill.Module, and let you group related tasks together to keep things neat and organized. Mill’s comes with built in modules such as mill.scalalib.ScalaModule and mill.scalalib.CrossSbtModule, but you can use modules for other purposes as well. The path to a Mill module from the root of your build file corresponds to the path you would use to run tasks within that module from the command line. e.g. for the following build: object foo extends mill.Module { def bar = T { \"hello\" } object baz extends mill.Module { def qux = T { \"world\" } } } You would be able to run the two targets via mill foo.bar or mill foo.baz.qux. You can use mill show foo.bar or mill show foo.baz.qux to make Mill echo out the string value being returned by each Target. The two targets will store their output metadata & files at ./out/foo/bar and ./out/foo/baz/qux respectively. Modules also provide a way to define and re-use common collections of tasks, via Scala traits. For example, you can define your own FooModule trait: trait FooModule extends mill.Module { def bar = T { \"hello\" } def baz = T { \"world\" } } And use it to define multiple modules with the same bar and baz targets, along with any other customizations such as qux: object foo1 extends FooModule object foo2 extends FooModule { def qux = T { \"I am Cow\" } } This would make the following targets available from the command line mill show foo1.bar mill show foo1.baz mill show foo2.bar mill show foo2.baz mill show foo2.qux The built-in mill.scalalib package uses this to define mill.scalalib.ScalaModule, mill.scalalib.SbtModule and mill.scalalib.TestScalaModule, all of which contain a set of \"standard\" operations such as compile, jar or assembly that you may expect from a typical Scala module. When defining your own module abstractions, in general you should use traits and not `class`es, except in the case of Cross Builds. trait BaseModule extends Module { def foo = T { Seq(\"base\") } def cmd(i: Int) = T.command { Seq(\"base\" + i) } } object canOverrideSuper with BaseModule { def foo = T { super.foo() ++ Seq(\"object\") } def cmd(i: Int) = T.command { super.cmd(i)() ++ Seq(\"object\" + i) } } You can override targets and commands to customize them or change what they do. The overridden version is available via super. You can omit the override keyword in Mill builds. Each Module has a millSourcePath field that corresponds to the path that module expects its input files to be on disk. Re-visiting our examples above: object foo extends mill.Module { def bar = T { \"hello\" } object baz extends mill.Module { def qux = T { \"world\" } } } The foo module has a millSourcePath of ./foo, while the foo.baz module has a millSourcePath of ./foo/baz. You can use millSourcePath to automatically set the source folders of your modules to match the build structure. You are not forced to rigidly use millSourcePath to define the source folders of all your code, but it can simplify the common case where you probably want your build-layout and on-disk-layout to be the same. E.g. for mill.scalalib.ScalaModule, the Scala source code is assumed by default to be in millSourcePath / \"src\" while resources are automatically assumed to be in millSourcePath / \"resources\". You can override millSourcePath: build.sc object foo extends mill.Module { def millSourcePath = super.millSourcePath / \"lols\" def bar = T { \"hello\" } object baz extends mill.Module { def qux = T { \"world\" } } } And any overrides propagate down to the module’s children: in the above example, module foo would have its millSourcePath be ./foo/lols while module`foo.baz` would have its millSourcePath be ./foo/lols/baz. Note that millSourcePath is generally only used for a module’s input source files. Output is always in the out/ folder and cannot be changed, e.g. even with the overridden millSourcePath the output paths are still the default ./out/foo/bar and ./out/foo/baz/qux folders. Libraries for use in Mill can define ExternalModules: Modules which are shared between all builds which use that library: package foo import mill._ object Bar extends mill.define.ExternalModule { def baz = T { 1 } def qux() = T.command { println(baz() + 1) } lazy val millDiscover = mill.define.Discover[this.type] } In the above example, foo.Bar is an ExternalModule living within the foo Java package, containing the baz target and qux command. Those can be run from the command line via: mill foo.Bar/baz mill foo.Bar/qux ExternalModules are useful for someone providing a library for use with Mill that is shared by the entire build: for example, mill.scalalib.ZincWorkerApi/zincWorker provides a shared Scala compilation service & cache that is shared between all ScalaModules, and mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea lets you generate IntelliJ projects without needing to define your own T.command in your build.sc file Mill can load other mill projects from external (or sub) folders, using Ammonite’s $file magic import, allowing to depend on foreign modules. This allows, for instance, to depend on other projects' sources, or split your build logic into smaller files. For instance, assuming the following structure : foo/ build.sc bar/ build.sc baz/ build.sc you can write the following in foo/build.sc : import $file.bar.build import $file.^.baz.build import mill._ def someFoo = T { ^.baz.build.someBaz(...) bar.build.someBar(...) ... } The output of the foreign tasks will be cached under foo/out/foreign-modules/.","title":"Modules","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Modules","url":"/mill/Modules.html","titles":[{"text":"Using Modules","hash":"_using_modules","id":1},{"text":"Overriding Targets","hash":"_overriding_targets","id":2},{"text":"millSourcePath","hash":"_millsourcepath","id":3},{"text":"External Modules","hash":"_external_modules","id":4},{"text":"Foreign Modules","hash":"_foreign_modules","id":5}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"This plugin allows publishing to Artifactory. import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-artifactory:` import mill.contrib.artifactory.ArtifactoryPublishModule object mymodule extends ArtifactoryPublishModule { def artifactoryUri: String = \"https://example.com/artifactory/my-repo\" def artifactorySnapshotUri: String = \"https://example.com/artifactory/my-snapshot-repo\" ... } Then in your terminal: $ mill mymodule.publishArtifactory --credentials $ARTIFACTORY_USER:$ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD","title":"Artifactory","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Plugin_Artifactory","url":"/mill/Plugin_Artifactory.html","titles":[{"text":"Quickstart","hash":"_quickstart","id":1}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"The contrib.bsp module is now included in mill by default and will eventually replace GenIdea.

There is no specific Play Java support, building a Play Java application will require a bit of customization (mostly adding the proper dependencies). There are 2 base modules and 2 helper traits in this plugin, all of which can be found in mill.playlib. The base modules: PlayModule applies the default Play configuration (layout, dependencies, routes compilation, Twirl compilation and Akka HTTP server) PlayApiModule applies the default Play configuration without Twirl templating. This is useful if your Play app is a pure API server or if you want to use a different templating engine. The two helper traits: SingleModule can be useful to configure mill for a single module Play application such as the play-scala-seed project. Mill is multi-module by default and requires a bit more configuration to have source, resource, and test directories at the top level alongside the build.sc file. This trait takes care of that (See Using SingleModule below). RouterModule allows you to use the Play router without the rest of the configuration (see Using the router module directly.) In order to use the PlayModule for your application, you need to provide the scala, Play and Twirl versions. You also need to define your own test object which extends the provided PlayTests trait. build.sc import mill._ import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-playlib:`, mill.playlib._ object core extends PlayModule { //config override def scalaVersion= T{\"2.12.8\"} override def playVersion= T{\"2.7.0\"} override def twirlVersion= T{\"1.4.0\"} object test extends PlayTests } Using the above definition, your build will be configured to use the default Play layout: . ├── build.sc └── core ├── app │ ├── controllers │ └── views ├── conf │ └── application.conf │ └── routes │ └── ... ├── logs ├── public │ ├── images │ ├── javascripts │ └── stylesheets └── test └── controllers The following compile dependencies will automatically be added to your build: Agg( ivy\"com.typesafe.play::play:${playVersion()}\", ivy\"com.typesafe.play::play-guice:${playVersion()}\", ivy\"com.typesafe.play::play-server:${playVersion()}\", ivy\"com.typesafe.play::play-logback:${playVersion()}\" ) Scala test will be setup as the default test framework and the following test dependencies will be added (the actual version depends on the version of Play you are pulling 2.6.x or 2.7.x): ivy\"org.scalatestplus.play::scalatestplus-play::4.0.1\" In order to have a working start command the following runtime dependency is also added: ivy\"com.typesafe.play::play-akka-http-server:${playVersion()}\" The PlayApiModule trait behaves the same as the PlayModule trait but it won’t process .scala .html files and you don’t need to define the `twirlVersion: build.sc import mill._ import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-playlib:$MILL_VERSION`, mill.playlib._ object core extends PlayApiModule { //config override def scalaVersion= T{\"2.12.8\"} override def playVersion= T{\"2.7.0\"} object test extends PlayTests } The Play modules themselves don’t have specific configuration options at this point but the router module configuration options and the [_twirl_configuration_options] are applicable. The following helpers are available to provide additional Play Framework dependencies: core() - added by default , guice() - added by default, server() - added by default, logback() - added by default, evolutions() - optional, jdbc() - optional, filters() - optional, ws() - optional, caffeine() - optional. If you want to add an optional library using the helper you can do so by overriding ivyDeps like in the following example build: build.sc import mill._ import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-playlib:$MILL_VERSION`, mill.playlib._ object core extends PlayApiModule { //config override def scalaVersion= T{\"2.12.8\"} override def playVersion= T{\"2.7.0\"} object test extends PlayTests override def ivyDeps = T{ super.ivyDeps() ++ Agg(ws(), filters()) } } Mill commands are targets on a named build. For example if your build is called core: compile: core.compile run: NOT Implemented yet. It can be approximated with mill -w core.runBackground but this starts a server in PROD mode which: doesn’t do any kind of classloading magic (meaning potentially slower restarts) returns less detailed error messages (no source code extract and line numbers) can sometimes fail because of a leftover RUNNING_PID file start: core.start or core.run both start the server in PROD mode. test: core.test dist: NOT Implemented yet. However you can use the equivalent core.assembly command to get a runnable fat jar of the project. The packaging is slightly different but should be find for a production deployment. The SingleModule trait allows you to have the build descriptor at the same level as the source code on the filesystem. You can move from there to a multi-module build either by refactoring your directory layout into multiple subdirectories or by using mill’s nested modules feature. Looking back at the sample build definition in Using PlayModule: build.sc import mill._ import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-playlib:$MILL_VERSION`, mill.playlib._ object core extends PlayModule { //config override def scalaVersion= T{\"2.12.8\"} override def playVersion= T{\"2.7.0\"} override def twirlVersion= T{\"1.4.0\"} object test extends PlayTests } The directory layout was: . ├── build.sc └── core ├── app │ ├── controllers │ └── views ├── conf │ └── application.conf │ └── routes │ └── ... ├── logs ├── public │ ├── images │ ├── javascripts │ └── stylesheets └── test └── controllers by mixing in the SingleModule trait in your build: build.sc import mill._ import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-playlib:`, mill.playlib._ object core extends PlayModule with SingleModule { //config override def scalaVersion= T{\"2.12.8\"} override def playVersion= T{\"2.7.0\"} override def twirlVersion= T{\"1.4.0\"} object test extends PlayTests } the layout becomes: . └── core ├── build.sc ├── app │ ├── controllers │ └── views ├── conf │ └── application.conf │ └── routes │ └── ... ├── logs ├── public │ ├── images │ ├── javascripts │ └── stylesheets └── test └── controllers If you want to use the router module in a project which doesn’t use the default Play layout, you can mix-in the mill.playlib.routesModule trait directly when defining your module. Your app must define playVersion and scalaVersion. build.sc import mill._ import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-playlib:`, mill.playlib._ object app extends ScalaModule with RouterModule { def playVersion= T{\"2.7.0\"} def scalaVersion= T{\"2.12.8\"} } def playVersion: T[String] (mandatory) - The version of Play to use to compile the routes file. def scalaVersion: T[String] - The scalaVersion in use in your project. def routes: Sources - The directory which contains your route files.

This directory must be added to the generated sources of the module to be compiled and made accessible from the rest of the code.

If you need to output the version numbers (for example for other CI tools you might use), you can use the following commands: # Show the current version from the version file. $ mill show versionFile.currentVersion # Show the version that would be used as release version. $ mill show versionFile.releaseVersion # Show the version that would be used as next version with the given --bump argument. $ mill show versionFile.nextVersion --bump minor The module has an exec task that allows you to execute tasks of type T[Seq[os.proc]]: $ mill mill.contrib.versionfile.VersionFile/exec --procs versionFile.tag $ mill mill.contrib.versionfile.VersionFile/exec --procs versionFile.push The VersionFileModule comes with two tasks of this type: Commits the changes, then creates a tag with the current version for that commit. Commits the changes, then pushes the changes to origin/master with tags. It’s possible to override the tasks above, or add your own tasks, to adapt the module to work with other version control systems than git.","title":"Version file","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Plugin_VersionFile","url":"/mill/Plugin_VersionFile.html","titles":[{"text":"Quickstart","hash":"_quickstart","id":1},{"text":"Configure the version file","hash":"_configure_the_version_file","id":2},{"text":"Set release version","hash":"_set_release_version","id":3},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":4},{"text":"Set next version","hash":"_set_next_version","id":5},{"text":"Parameters","hash":"_parameters","id":6},{"text":"–bump (major | minor | patch)","hash":"_bump_major_minor_patch","id":7},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example_2","id":8},{"text":"Set version","hash":"_set_version","id":9},{"text":"Parameters","hash":"_parameters_2","id":10},{"text":"–version x.y.z[-SNAPSHOT]","hash":"_version_x_y_z_snapshot","id":11},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example_3","id":12},{"text":"Output version numbers","hash":"_output_version_numbers","id":13},{"text":"VCS operations","hash":"_vcs_operations","id":14},{"text":"Built-in git operations","hash":"_built_in_git_operations","id":15},{"text":"Tag","hash":"_tag","id":16},{"text":"Push","hash":"_push","id":17},{"text":"Custom operations","hash":"_custom_operations","id":18}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"There are several APIs available to you within the body of a T {…​} or T.command {…​} block to help your write the code implementing your Target or Command: T.dest implicitly[mill.api.Ctx.Dest] This is a unique os.Path (e.g. out/classFiles.dest/ or out/run.dest/) that is assigned to every Target or Command. It is cleared before your task runs, and you can use it as a scratch space for temporary files or a place to put returned artifacts.

Messages logged with log.debug appear by default only in the log files. You can use the --debug option when running mill to show them on the console too. T.ctx.env implicitly[mill.api.Ctx.Env] Mill keeps a long-lived JVM server to avoid paying the cost of recurrent classloading. Because of this, running System.getenv in a task might not yield up to date environment variables, since it will be initialised when the server starts, rather than when the client executes. To circumvent this, mill’s client sends the environment variables to the server as it sees them, and the server makes them available as a Map[String, String] via the Ctx API. If the intent is to always pull the latest environment values, the call should be wrapped in an Input as such : def envVar = T.input { T.ctx.env.get(\"ENV_VAR\") }","title":"Task Context API","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Task_Context_API","url":"/mill/Task_Context_API.html","titles":[{"text":"mill.api.Ctx.Dest","hash":"_mill_api_ctx_dest","id":1},{"text":"mill.api.Ctx.Log","hash":"_mill_api_ctx_log","id":2},{"text":"mill.api.Ctx.Env","hash":"_mill_api_ctx_env","id":3}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"One of Mill’s core abstractions is its Task Graph: this is how Mill defines, orders and caches work it needs to do, and exists independently of any support for building Scala. The following is a simple self-contained example using Mill to compile Java: import mill._, mill.modules.Jvm // sourceRoot -> allSources -> classFiles // | // v // resourceRoot ----> jar def sourceRoot = T.sources { T.workspace / \"src\" } def resourceRoot = T.sources { T.workspace / \"resources\" } def allSources = T { sourceRoot().flatMap(p => os.walk(p.path)).map(PathRef(_)) } def classFiles = T { os.makeDir.all(T.dest) os.proc(\"javac\", allSources().map(_.path.toString()), \"-d\", T.dest) .call(cwd = T.dest) PathRef(T.dest) } def jar = T { Jvm.createJar(Agg(classFiles().path) ++ resourceRoot().map(_.path)) } def run(mainClsName: String) = T.command { os.proc(\"java\", \"-cp\", classFiles().path, mainClsName).call() } Here, we have two T.sources, sourceRoot and resourceRoot, which act as the roots of our task graph. allSources depends on sourceRoot by calling sourceRoot() to extract its value, classFiles depends on allSources the same way, and jar depends on both classFiles and resourceRoot. Filesystem operations in Mill are done using the os-lib library. The above build defines the following task graph: Task graph for jar sourceRoot -> allSources -> classFiles | v resourceRoot ----> jar When you first evaluate jar (e.g. via mill jar at the command line), it will evaluate all the defined targets: sourceRoot, allSources, classFiles, resourceRoot and jar. Subsequent invocations of mill jar will evaluate only as much as is necessary, depending on what input sources changed: If the files in sourceRoot change, it will re-evaluate allSources, compiling to classFiles, and building the jar If the files in resourceRoot change, it will only re-evaluate jar and use the cached output of allSources and classFiles There are three primary kinds of Tasks that you should care about: Targets, defined using T {…​} Sources, defined using T.sources {…​} Commands, defined using T.command {…​} def allSources = T { os.walk(sourceRoot().path).map(PathRef(_)) } Targets are defined using the def foo = T {…​} syntax, and dependencies on other targets are defined using foo() to extract the value from them. Apart from the foo() calls, the T {…​} block contains arbitrary code that does some work and returns a result. Each target, e.g. classFiles, is assigned a path on disk as scratch space & to store its output files at out/classFiles.dest/, and its returned metadata is automatically JSON-serialized and stored at out/classFiles.json. The return-value of targets has to be JSON-serializable via uPickle. In case you want return your own case class (e.g. MyCaseClass), you can make it JSON-serializable by adding the following implicit def to its companion object: object MyCaseClass { implicit def rw: upickle.default.ReadWriter[MyCaseClass] = upickle.default.macroRW } If you want to return a file or a set of files as the result of a Target, write them to disk within your T.dest available through the Task_Context_API.adoc#_mill_api_ctx_dest and return a PathRef(T.dest) that hashes the files you wrote. If a target’s inputs change but its output does not, e.g. someone changes a comment within the source files that doesn’t affect the classfiles, then downstream targets do not re-evaluate. This is determined using the .hashCode of the Target’s return value. For targets returning os.Paths that reference files on disk, you can wrap the Path in a PathRef (shown above) whose .hashCode() will include the hashes of all files on disk at time of creation. The graph of inter-dependent targets is evaluated in topological order; that means that the body of a target will not even begin to evaluate if one of its upstream dependencies has failed. This is unlike normal Scala functions: a plain old function foo would evaluate halfway and then blow up if one of foo's dependencies throws an exception. Targets cannot take parameters and must be 0-argument defs defined directly within a Module body. def sourceRootPath = os.pwd / \"src\" def sourceRoots = T.sources { sourceRootPath } Sources are defined using T.sources {…​}, taking one-or-more os.Paths as arguments. A Source is a subclass of Target[Seq[PathRef]]: this means that its build signature/hashCode depends not just on the path it refers to (e.g. foo/bar/baz) but also the MD5 hash of the filesystem tree under that path. T.sources also has an overload which takes Seq[PathRef], to let you override-and-extend source lists the same way you would any other T {…​} definition: def additionalSources = T.sources { os.pwd / \"additionalSources\" } override def sourceRoots = T.sources { super.sourceRoots() ++ additionalSources() } def run(mainClsName: String) = T.command { os.proc(\"java\", \"-cp\", classFiles().path, mainClsName).call() } Defined using T.command {…​} syntax, Commands can run arbitrary code, with dependencies declared using the same foo() syntax (e.g. classFiles() above). Commands can be parametrized, but their output is not cached, so they will re-evaluate every time even if none of their inputs have changed. A command with no parameter is defined as def myCommand() = T.command {…​}. It is a compile error if () is missing. Like Targets, a command only evaluates after all its upstream dependencies have completed, and will not begin to run if any upstream dependency has failed. Commands are assigned the same scratch/output folder out/run.dest/ as Targets are, and its returned metadata stored at the same out/run.json path for consumption by external tools. Commands can only be defined directly within a Module body. Anonymous Tasks, defined using T.task {…​} Persistent Targets Inputs Workers def foo(x: Int) = T.task { ... x ... bar() ... } You can define anonymous tasks using the T.task {…​} syntax. These are not runnable from the command-line, but can be used to share common code you find yourself repeating in Targets and Commands. def downstreamTarget = T { ... foo(42)() ... } def downstreamCommand(x: Int) = T.command { ... foo(x)() ... } Anonymous task’s output does not need to be JSON-serializable, their output is not cached, and they can be defined with or without arguments. Unlike Targets or Commands, anonymous tasks can be defined anywhere and passed around any way you want, until you finally make use of them within a downstream target or command. While an anonymous task foo's own output is not cached, if it is used in a downstream target baz and the upstream target bar hasn’t changed, baz's cached output will be used and foo's evaluation will be skipped altogether. def foo = T.persistent { ... } Identical to Targets, except that the dest/ folder is not cleared in between runs. This is useful if you are running external incremental-compilers, such as Scala’s Zinc, Javascript’s WebPack, which rely on filesystem caches to speed up incremental execution of their particular build step. Since Mill no longer forces a \"clean slate\" re-evaluation of T.persistent targets, it is up to you to ensure your code (or the third-party incremental compilers you rely on!) are deterministic. They should always converge to the same outputs for a given set of inputs, regardless of what builds and what filesystem states existed before. def foo = T.input { ... } A generalization of Sources, T.inputs are tasks that re-evaluate every time (unlike Anonymous Tasks), containing an arbitrary block of code. Inputs can be used to force re-evaluation of some external property that may affect your build. For example, if I have a Target bar that makes use of the current git version: def bar = T { ... os.proc(\"git\", \"rev-parse\", \"HEAD\").call().out.text() ... } bar will not know that git rev-parse can change, and will not know to re-evaluate when your git rev-parse HEAD does change. This means bar will continue to use any previously cached value, and bar's output will be out of date! To fix this, you can wrap your git rev-parse HEAD in a T.input: def foo = T.input { os.proc(\"git\", \"rev-parse\", \"HEAD\").call().out.text() } def bar = T { ... foo() ... } This makes foo to always re-evaluate every build; if git rev-parse HEAD does not change, that will not invalidate bar's caches. But if git rev-parse HEAD does change, foo's output will change and bar will be correctly invalidated and re-compute using the new version of foo. Note that because T.inputs re-evaluate every time, you should ensure that the code you put in T.input runs quickly. Ideally it should just be a simple check \"did anything change?\" and any heavy-lifting should be delegated to downstream targets. def foo = T.worker { ... } Most tasks dispose of their in-memory return-value every evaluation; in the case of Targets, this is stored on disk and loaded next time if necessary, while Commands just re-compute them each time. Even if you use --watch or the Build REPL to keep the Mill process running, all this state is still discarded and re-built every evaluation. Workers are unique in that they store their in-memory return-value between evaluations. This makes them useful for storing in-memory caches or references to long-lived external worker processes that you can re-use. Mill uses workers to manage long-lived instances of the Zinc Incremental Scala Compiler and the Scala.js Optimizer. This lets us keep them in-memory with warm caches and fast incremental execution. Like Persistent Targets, Workers inherently involve mutable state, and it is up to the implementation to ensure that this mutable state is only used for caching/performance and does not affect the externally-visible behavior of the worker. As Workers may also hold limited resources, it may be necessary to free up these resources once a worker is no longer needed. This is especially the case, when your worker tasks depends on other tasks and these tasks change, as Mill will then also create a new worker instance. To implement resource cleanup, your worker can implement java.lang.AutoCloseable. Once the worker is no longer needed, Mill will call the close() method on it before any newer version of this worker is created. import mill._ import java.lang.AutoCloseable def myWorker = T.worker { new MyWorker with AutoCloseable { // ... override def close() = { /* cleanup and free resources */ } } } The following table might help you make sense of the small collection of different Task types: Target Command Source/Input Anonymous Task Persistent Target Worker Cached to Disk X X X Must be JSON Writable X X X X Must be JSON Readable X X Runnable from the Command Line X X X Can Take Arguments X X Cached between Evaluations X","title":"Tasks","component":"mill","version":"master","name":"Tasks","url":"/mill/Tasks.html","titles":[{"text":"Task Graphs","hash":"_task_graphs","id":1},{"text":"Primary Tasks","hash":"_primary_tasks","id":2},{"text":"Targets","hash":"_targets","id":3},{"text":"Sources","hash":"_sources","id":4},{"text":"Commands","hash":"_commands","id":5},{"text":"Other Tasks","hash":"_other_tasks","id":6},{"text":"Anonymous Tasks","hash":"_anonymous_tasks","id":7},{"text":"Persistent Targets","hash":"_persistent_targets","id":8},{"text":"Inputs","hash":"_inputs","id":9},{"text":"Workers","hash":"_workers","id":10},{"text":"Autoclosable Workers","hash":"_autoclosable_workers","id":11},{"text":"Task Cheat Sheet","hash":"_task_cheat_sheet","id":12}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"Provides support for TestNG.

Scala MDoc simply compiles properly marked Scala snippets in plain md files and optionally runs them through an interpreter, augmenting the code with the interpreter output. Project home: https://github.com/atooni/mill-mdoc Small script to automatically fetch and execute mill build tool. Project home: https://github.com/lefou/millw millw is a small wrapper script around mill and works almost identical to mill. It automatically downloads a mill release into $HOME/.mill/download. The mill version to be used will be determined by the following steps. The search ends, after the first step that results in a version. If the first parameter is --mill-version, the second parameter will be used as the mill version. Example ` sh $ mill --mill-version 0.3.6 --disable-ticker version 0.3.6 ` If there is a file .mill-version in the working directory, it’s content will be used as mill version. The file must have only a mill version as content, no additional content or comments are supported. Example ` sh $ echo -n \"0.3.6\" > .mill-version sh $ mill --disable-ticker version 0.3.6 ` The values of the DEFAULT_MILL_VERSION variable inside the script will be used. Istead of installing mill, you can just place the script into you local $HOME/bin directory and rename it to mill. If you need a special mill version in a project directory, just place a .mill-version file with the best mill version. Example: setting mill 0.3.6 as best local mill version sh $ echo -n \"0.3.6\" > .mill-version To make the start for others easier or to always have the correct mill version in your CI environment, you can just place a copy of the script as millw in your project root directory. You should change the DEFAULT_MILL_VERSION variable in that script to the correct version you want to use and add the file under version control. Check binary compatibility with mill.
